# Shareworks Interview Technical Assessment 

## Description
I assume that Shareworks is interviewing multiple candidates for their data team, so I wanted to do something beyond what was asked. Please read below to understand the process I followed to complete this assessment, and/or watch the video I made to show my work (PENDING URL).
* I used R to request data from the API (https://511.alberta.ca/help/endpoint/winterroads). 
* I wrote a new MS Access Database file. 
* I created a semi - normalized database schema to reduce the row count as opposed to a CSV.
* Using the ROBDC library in R, I wrote tables and stored data into the Access Database.
* I create functions to answer the first three questions asked by Shareworks:
  * What is the percentage of locations with good visibility?
  * Which areas of the province are experiencing poor visibility?
  * Which areas have bad conditions? 
* I next connected the access database to a PowerBI file. I opted to use PowerBI over leaflet / ggplot for time sake.
* I created a dashboard to visually represent my answers to the previous questions as well as the remaining question:
  * Can you provide a visualization showcasing the different conditions experienced by different parts of the province?
* The bonus question was answered at the bottom of my R code.
My R code, PowerBI dashboard, and my populate Access Database will all be available to download.

## Important Note
Question three asks me to identify areas which have bad conditions. Because I did not believe there is a "bad" condition type, the question is very subjective. I chose to include everything except "Bare wheel paths", "Bare Dry", and "No Report" in my definition of bad conditions. My rationale for this was based on The Alberta 511 website (https://511.alberta.ca/about/tutorial).

road.condition.obj <- GetCurrentWinterRoadConditionsAB()

# Connect an access database (  For Fun :)  )
dbCon <- odbcConnectAccess2007("AlbertaWinterRoadConditions.accdb")

# Create write data access database
#CreateDatabaseTables(road.conditions.obj, dbCon)

#Responses to Shareworks Questions
PercentageOfLocationsWithGoodVisibility(road.condition.obj)
AreasWithPoorVisibility(road.condition.obj)
AreasWithBadConditions(road.condition.obj, c("No Report", "Bare wheel paths", "Bare Dry"))
# Visualization was done in PowerBI (Opted to use this over leaflet/ggplot, so I could quickly make a full dashboard)

# BONUS: What other interesting insights can you find? How can this be used by the government to improve people's welling?
  # Save and analyze historical data in addition to traffic data, and collision data to improve road safety.
  # Determine which roads are in need of safety improvements. 
  # Determine if the risk associated with each road is environment or driver based. Improve roads accordingly
